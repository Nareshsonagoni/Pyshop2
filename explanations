you give user a title to pick from the list
then, you show the user a (scrambled) movie name with blanks in it
and tell the user to fill the blank words
if user guesses right missing letters in the blanks, the game should progress to next movie name
else if user makes more wrong guesses in the blank then the title name, the game should be end.
every time user makes a wrong guess the mistake should add to itself, when the total wrong guesses = to title name =>> end.


Think of class as building structure with ten floors
so basement of this building is like a constructor
from the basement you can access all the floors in the building
each floor represents as a function(method)
so attributes are like a lift
